âœ… What Can You Do to Improve It?
Here are options to add realism or sharper turning points:

1. Use Tree-Based Models for Forecasting
Train and forecast with RandomForest, XGBoost, or even GradientBoostingRegressor. These:

Capture non-linearities and feature interactions

Often show more realistic jumps in prices
(But they need more careful feature prep for recursive forecasting)

2. Introduce Exogenous Signals
Feed in:

Day-of-week dummies

Volatility index proxies (e.g., Nifty VIX)

Sentiment score (from news, Twitter, etc.)
This helps the model respond to real-world conditions.

3. Forecast in Multi-Step Mode
Instead of predicting recursively day-by-day:

Predict all future values in one batch using lag structure

Reduces accumulation of compounding error

4. Switch to Sequence Models
Use LSTM, GRU, or Temporal Fusion Transformer (advanced).

These preserve memory of trends

Useful when you have many past data points and complex behavior
